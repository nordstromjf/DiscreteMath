<ul class="disc">
<li>\(\mathbb{R}\text{,}\) the set of real numbers. These are all the numbers your are familiar with from Calculus: whole numbers, positives, negatives, fractions, decimals, square roots, \(e\text{,}\) \(\pi\text{,}\) etc.</li>
<li>\(\mathbb{Z}\text{,}\) the set integers. These are all the whole numbers: positive, negative, and zero.</li>
<li>\(\mathbb{Q}\text{,}\) the set rational numbers. These are all the whole numbers and fractions: positive, negative, and zero. We will revisit this set in more detail later.</li>
<li>\(\mathbb{N}\text{,}\) the set of natural numbers. These are all the positive whole numbers. Some books include zero, some do not. Since this can be confusing, we will avoid this notation in this class (but you might see it in future classes). Intead, we will use one of the next two notations, which more clearly denote inclusion of zero, or not.</li>
<li>\(\mathbb{Z}^+\text{,}\) the set of positive integers. These are all the positive whole numbers. This set does NOT include zero.</li>
<li>\(\mathbb{Z}^{nonneg}\text{,}\) the set of nonnegative integers. These are the whole numbers that are not negative. This set DOES include zero.</li>
