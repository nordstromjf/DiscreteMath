<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">In the last section, we looked at the idea of divisibility. Remember, this is a relationship between two integers, not actual division. We will continue to focus on integers. One of the issues with division of integers is that if you divide two integers, you no longer necessarily have an integer. So what if the only numbers we are allowed to use are integers? Can we still somehow think of division? Well, yes, this is in fact how you were probably introduced to division long ago. When you were first learning arithmetic, you only had integers to work with.</p>
