<p>Our second classical theorem is to prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. We previously proved there are infinitely many integers. In that proof, if we had a biggest integer, \(N\text{,}\) we were able to construct an integer that was greater than \(N\text{,}\) namely \(N+1\text{.}\) However, primes are not that nice. If you were to list out several prime numbers, it would be impossible to find a pattern for the “next” prime. Sometimes primes are close together, like 17 and 19, and sometimes they are far apart. In fact, it is possible to prove that we can find a list of \(n\) consecutive integers where none of the consecutive integers are prime for any positive integer \(n\text{.}\) This means there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive integers with no primes, or there are primes that are arbitrarily far apart.</p>
