<p>Suppose a study was done with three drugs, A, B and C. A total of 50 subjects used all three drugs. They reported which drugs made them feel better, with the following results:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>21 felt better with A</li>
<li>21 felt better with B</li>
<li>31 felt better with C</li>
<li>9 felt better with A and B</li>
<li>14 felt better with A and C</li>
<li>15 felt better with B and C</li>
<li>41 felt better with at least one drug</li>
</ul>
<p data-braille="continuation">Some of the subjects who had relief from, say, A, might also have had relief from another drug. So some of the 21 who reported feeling better with A, may also be included in the count of the 9 who felt better with A and B.</p>
