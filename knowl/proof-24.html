<p>Base Step: Let \(n=2\text{.}\) Then \(2\mid 2\) and 2 is prime.</p>
<p>Thus, \(n\) is divisible by a prime..</p>
<p>Induction Step:</p>
<p>Assume \(i\) is divisible by a prime for all \(2\leq i\leq k\) and for some \(k\geq 2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Show \(k+1\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Proof of induction step:</p>
<p>Case 1: \(k+1\) is prime. Now, \(k+1\mid k+1\) and hence \(k+1\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Case 2: \(k+1\) is not prime. Thus \(k+1=ab\) where \(1&lt; a &lt; k+1\text{.}\) Then \(2\leq a\leq k\text{.}\) By our induction assumption, \(a\) must be divisible by a prime. Since \(a\mid k+1\) and \(a\) is divisible by a prime, \(k+1\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Thus, by induction, every \(n&gt;1\) is divisible by a prime.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="stronginduction5-4.html#proof-24">in-context</a></span>
