<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Suppose you want to choose a group of 3 students in a class of 15 for a group project. How many ways can you choose the group?</p>
<p>We use combinations: \(\binom{15}{3}\text{.}\) It does not matter if a member was chosen first, second, or third, they would still be a member of the group. Thus, there are \(\frac{15!}{3!12!}=455\) ways to choose a group of 3.</p>
<p>Now suppose you want to choose a group of 3 students in a class of 15 for a group project, but the first student chosen will be the note-taker, the second will be the presenter, the third will manage the discussion. How many ways can you choose the group?</p>
<p>We use permutations: \(P(15, 3)\text{.}\) Now it DOES matter if a member was chosen first, second, or third, as each member has a different role. Thus, there are \(\frac{15!}{12!}=2730\) ways to choose a group of 3 where the members' roles are defined.</p></article></body>
