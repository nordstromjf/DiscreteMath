<p>You might have noticed in this last proof that each of the subsets proofs are really just the reverse of each other. If all the implications in our proof are really “if and only if” statements, then we can write the proof more succinctly as a single “if and only if” proof. We will show that in the next example. Be careful with if and only if proofs, though. Make sure that at each step both directions of the conditional are true. If you are unsure, you can always write you proof in two stages, as we did in the previous example.</p>
