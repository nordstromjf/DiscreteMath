<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The Fibonacci sequence is a good example of a recursively defined sequence where it is difficult to find an explicit formula. An explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence does exist, we will see it in the next section, but it requires much more sophisticated mathematics to find it than anything we will see in this course. If you are interested, though, this is the sort of thing you would see if you take Combinatorics. When we do see it, it should be clear that it is computationally MUCH harder than the recursive definiton (which is why you rarely see it when working with the Fibonacci sequence).</p>
