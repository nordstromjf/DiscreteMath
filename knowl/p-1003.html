<p>The proofs we did in the last sections involed looking at elements in sets. We could translate statements about sets into logical statement such as "and"s, "or"s, and conditionals. This allowed us to prove many other properties of sets, such as DeMorgan's Laws. But now that we have these properties, we can use them to prove new properties in a more algebraic way.</p>
