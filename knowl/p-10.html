<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Throughout this course we will need to become more familiar with the language of mathematics. This includes mathematical statements using symbols, such as in an algebra class, but also includes statements about mathematics, such as definitions and theorems. Mathematics uses terminology in a very precise manner. Such precision is useful mathematically, but often obscurs conceptual understanding. In this course we will  work to bridge the gap between conceptual understanding and mathematical precision.</p>
