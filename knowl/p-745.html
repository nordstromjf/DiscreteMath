<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now we apply induction to statements involving inequalities. These will be some of the most challenging induction proofs as they often take a bit more trial and error in the scratchwork. When dealing with equalities, you know for example, that you have to add the same thing to both sides. However, with inequalities you can change one side as long as you maintain the inequality. For example, if you know \(P&gt;Q\text{,}\) then you also know \(P+2&gt;Q\text{.}\) The fact that we can change one side of the expression makes it more challenging to see what steps to take.</p>
