<p>Some comments about divisibility proofs:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>You will likely need to do scratchwork. Do not include the scratchwork in your actual proof.</li>
<li>The point of the proof is that the reader can follow all of the steps. You do not need to explain where your choices came from. For example, in the proof above, it might not be obvious why you should add \(3k^2+3k\text{,}\) but the reader just needs to know that 3 divides the expression, which is clear.</li>
<li>Divisibility proofs in this form can be challenging to do at first, but with practice, they often end up being some of the easier induction proofs to do, as they all follow a similar format.</li>
