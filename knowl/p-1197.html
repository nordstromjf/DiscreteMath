<p>We can use directed graphs to help identify the properties.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Reflexive.</span></h6> If a relation is reflexive, then the directed graph will have an arrow from the vertex to itself (a loop) at every vertex.</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Symmetric.</span></h6> If a relation is symmetric, then whenever the directed graph has an arrow from vertex, \(v\) to vertex \(u\text{,}\) there is a corresponding arrow  going from \(u\) to \(v\text{.}\)</li>
<li>
<h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Transitive.</span></h6> If a relation is transitive, then whenever the directed graph has an arrow from vertex, \(v\) to vertex \(u\) followed by an arrow from \(u\) to \(w\text{,}\) there is a corresponding arrow  going from \(v\) to \(w\text{.}\)</li>
