<p>Think of some examples of variables  you've seen in other math classes. What do these variables represent? Probably, the first example that comes to mind is something from an algebra class, such as \(y=x^2\) or \(f(x)=3x+2\text{.}\) You may also think of examples such as solving for \(x\) in an expression such as \(x^2=4\text{.}\) We use variables in matheamtical statements to represent a quantity that can vary. But we also use them to be more precise. Think of how much more confusing the first statement would be if we had to write it as "a number squared equals another number;" or the second statement, "the function which multiplies an number by 3 and adds 2." When you first learned varables, you perobably WERE introduced to them in terms of sentences, but eventually, you got used to what the symbols mean.</p>
