<body><article class="example example-like"><p>Express the sum, \(\sum_{i=0}^{n}\binom{n}{i}x^i\text{,}\) in closed form.</p>
<p>We think of writing out the sum as expanding, so the closed form means the power of a binomial.</p>
<p>For problems such as this, we need to identify \(a\) and \(b\) as in the Binomial Theorem.</p>
<p>We can see that \(x=b\text{.}\) Since there does not appear to be any term for \(a\text{,}\) we can let \(a=1\text{.}\) Thus, the closed form is \((1+x)^n\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
