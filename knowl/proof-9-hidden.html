<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>We will divide this proof into two cases, where \(n\) is prime and where \(n\) is composite.</p>
<p>Case 1: \(n\) is prime. We can see that \(n\mid n\text{.}\) Since \(\text{}\) is prime, \(n\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Case 2: \(n\) is composite. Then \(n=r_0s_0\) where \(1&lt; r_0 &lt; n\text{.}\) If \(r_0\) is prime, then \(n\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>If \(r_0\) is not prime, then \(r_0=r_1s_1\) where \(1&lt; r_1 &lt; r_0\text{.}\) If \(r_1\) is prime, then \(n=r_1s_1s_0\) and \(n\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Similarly, if \(r_1\) is not prime, then \(r_1=r_2s_2\) where \(1&lt; r_2 &lt; r_1 &lt; r_0\text{,}\) etc.</p>
<p>We can keep applying this process to get \(n=r_ks_k\cdots s_0\) with \(1&lt; r_k &lt;\cdots&lt; r_1 &lt; r_0\text{.}\)</p>
<p>If any \(r_k\) is prime, then we are done, as we have found a prime divisor of \(n\text{.}\) We know that there cannot be infinitely many non-prime \(r_k\) since there are only finitely many integers between 1 and \(n\text{.}\) Thus, the process must terminate with a prime divisor of \(n\text{.}\) Hence, every integer is divisible by a prime.</p></article></body>
