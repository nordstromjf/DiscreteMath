<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Base Step: Let \(n=2\text{.}\) Then \(2\mid 2\) and 2 is prime.</p>
<p>Thus, \(n\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Induction Step:</p>
<p>Assume \(k\) is divisible by a prime for some \(k\geq 2\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Show \(k+1\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>“Proof” of induction step:</p>
<p>Case 1: \(k+1\) is prime. Now, \(k+1\mid k+1\) and hence \(k+1\) is divisible by a prime.</p>
<p>Case 2: \(k+1\) is not prime. This is were we get stuck, since although we know \(k\) is divisible by a prime, that doesn't tell us anything about \(k+1\text{.}\) In fact we showed that any prime dividing \(k\) CANNOT divide \(k+1\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Thus, regular induction is not going to work for this proof.</p></article></body>
