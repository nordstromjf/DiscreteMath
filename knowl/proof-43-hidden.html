<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>By definition, \(\binom{n}{r}\) is the number of subsets where we choose \(r\) objects from \(n\) objects. We can create a set of \(r\) objects by specifying which objects are in the set or by specifying which objects are NOT in the set. We note that there are \(n-r\) objects NOT in the set. Thus, \(\binom{n}{n-r}\) counts the ways to find a set of \(r\) objects out of \(n\) by finding the ways to not include \(n-r\) objects. Thus, both \(\binom{n}{r}\) and \(\binom{n}{n-r}\) count subsets of \(r\) objects from \(n\text{,}\) one by counting the objects in the set, one by counting the objects not in the set.</p></article></body>
