<p>We can think of negation as switching the quantifier and negating \(P(x)\text{,}\) but it will be really helpful if we can understand WHY this is the negation. Thinking about negating a “For all” statement, we need the statement to not be true for all things, which means it must be false for something, Thus, there exists something making \(\sim P(x)\) true. Thinking about negating a “there exists” statement, we need there not to exist anything making \(P(x)\) true, which means \(P(x)\) must be false for everything. Thus, everything makes \(\sim P(x)\) true.</p>
