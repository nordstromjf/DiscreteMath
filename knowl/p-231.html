<p>If you look back at the Check your Understanding questions in the previous section, you should notice that both \(\forall x\in D, P(x)\) and \(\forall x\in D, \sim P(x)\) were false, which means they are not negations of each other. Similarly, both \(\exists x\in D, P(x)\) and \(\exists x \in D, \sim P(x)\) were true. In general, the two statements won't necessarily have the same truth values, but the examples were chosen to make sure we can see that they are not negations of each other.</p>
